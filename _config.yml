    message: "Ice patterns formed and reformed on the screen as he probed for gaps, skirted the most obvious traps, and mapped the route he'd take through Sense/Net's ice. It was good ice. Wonderful ice... Case searched the matrix around the Tessier-Ashpool ice until he found the pink structure, a standard commercial unit, and punched in closer to it... 'Boy, that is one mean piece of software. Hottest thing since sliced bread. That thing's invisible. I just now rented twenty seconds on that little pink box, four jumps left of the Tessier-Ashpool ice; had a look at what we look like. We don't. We're not there.'"
