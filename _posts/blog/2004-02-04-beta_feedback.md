We've put together a preliminary list of items we're looking for feedback on during the beta process:
<ul>
<li>Is the basic featureset in beta useful?</li>
<li>What additional features would you like to see?</li>
<li>Does the public API seem reasonable for integration into your application?</li>
<li>Does the software seem portable to the platform you're considering?</li>
<li>Is the code and documentation clear?</li>
<li>Have you found any bugs?</li>
</ul>
<br />
