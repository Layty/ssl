OpenSSL 1.0.2 and later accepts only strict encoding of ECDSA signatures as
signed integers, requiring a leading 0x0 byte in front of signatures which have
the high bit set in either the R or S parameters (statistically a 75% chance).
In the past OpenSSL (and MatrixSSL) treated the value as a "cast to unsigned",
which did not require a leading zero.
This release encodes with a leading zero when necessary,
which conforms to strict ASN.1 encoding. MatrixSSL still can receive signatures
encoded in either method. The encoding method does not affect the security of
the protocol.

<i>This update is only required for users of ECDH_ECDSA or ECDHE_ECDSA cipher
suites that interoperate with the latest version of OpenSSL.</i>
