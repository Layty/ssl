<ul>
<li><b>X.509 and ASN.1 Parsing Improvements</b> - <a href="http://www.intelsecurity.com/advanced-threat-research/" target='_new'>The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel
Security</a> 
discovered several issues as part of their research on the BERSerk attack on RSA signature verification.
MatrixSSL does not contain this vulnerability which can result in a MITM attack, however some other ASN.1 fields were not consistently checked against remaining buffer length when parsed.
These have each been fixed, and the getAsnLength() internal API now also does a double check against the remaining buffer length for variable length fields in all cases.
</li>
<li><b>Constant-Time Memory Compare</b> - Calls to memcmp() have been replaced with a memcmpct() implementation to reduce the effectiveness of future timing based attacks.
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p /> <b>New Features</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation</b> - Implemented <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7301.txt" target='_new'>RFC 7301</a>.
</li>
<li><b>X.509 RSASSA-PSS Signatures</b> - MatrixSSL now supports the more secure RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm in X.509 certificates.
</li>
<li><b>Run-Time TLS Feature Control</b> - Truncated HMAC use, Maximum Fragment Length requests, and Elliptic Curve specification can now be enabled on a per-session basis when creating a new session..
