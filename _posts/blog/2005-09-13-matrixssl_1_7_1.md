<b>Bug fixes and optimizations</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed certificate chain parsing bug where a valid certificate chain was marked as invalid under certain circumstances.  The result of the fix is that more cert chain configurations are supported.</li>
<li>Added support for cert validation when the server sends the Root CA cert in addition to the lower levels of the chain.  Typically the Root CA cert is loaded into the client, and not sent by the server. We have encountered some deployments where the server does send the root CA as well, and now successfully validate this chain.</li>
<li>Relaxed parsing of the CertificateSerialNumber field within AuthorityKeyIdentifier.  Although officially defined as an ASN.1 INTEGER type, some certificate generators use a non-integer value.  Parser now supports these technically incorrect datatypes.</li>
</ul>
