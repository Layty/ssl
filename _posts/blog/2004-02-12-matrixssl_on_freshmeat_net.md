We've registered MatrixSSL with freshmeat.net: <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/matrixssl/" target=_new>http://freshmeat.net/projects/matrixssl</a>.  Freshmeat is run by the same parent company as Slashdot, and is a searchable repository of open source projects.  Users can sign up to be notified when new releases are available for projects they use.  We provide a similar feature through our <a href="/index.xml">XML RSS feed</a>.
