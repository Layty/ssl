<b>Functional changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added legacy certificate support</li><br/>
- for certificates without basic constraints<br/>
- MD2 support for older certificates (Because it is a less secure algorithm, it must be explicitly enabled).
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Bug fixes and optimizations</b>
<ul>
<li>Sanity check against invalid key lengths from certificate (potential DOS fix)</li>
<li>Fixed 64 bit issue with mpi.c</li>
<li>Fix potential leak in certificates with duplicate fields</li>
<li>Allow application data parsing within re-handshake state</li>
</ul>
<br/>
