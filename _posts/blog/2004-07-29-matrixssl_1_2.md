<b>Functional changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added re-handshake support</li><br/>
- A connected server may issue a HelloRequest message to the client<br/>
- A connected client may issue a new ClientHello message to the server
<li>Added support for certificate chaining</li>
<li>Added RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA1 and RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5 ciphers to provide authentication and tamper detection without encryption overhead.  (Because these are less secure ciphers, they must be explicitly enabled in cipherSuite.c).
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Bug fixes and optimizations</b>
<ul>
<li>Cleaned up several mismatched types (mostly unsigned char to char compiler warnings)</li>
<li>Rework of the cipher suite logic to support re-handshaking</li>
<li>Rename internal APIs to avoid namespace issues with other packages</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>API changes from 1.1 release</b>
<ul>
<li>Added matrixSslSetSessionOption()</li>
<li>Added matrixSslEncodeHelloRequest()</li>
<li>Added 'next' member to the sslCertInfo_t structure.  This member creates a linked list to expose certificate chains to the user.</li>
</ul>
