<p><b>Functional changes</b><br />
<ul><li>Enabled SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA by default. The footprint remains the same, since 3DES was already included with the USE_ENCRYPTED_PRIVATE_KEYS define.  Note that this is the preferred cipher for many SSL clients, so by enabling this cipher, communications will default to a stronger, but slower cipher.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<b>Bug fixes and optimizations</b><br />
<ul><li>Safer memory usage for RSA blinding function.  Code was already safe for 1024 and 2048 bit keys, but this ensures the safety.</li><br />
<li>Properly compare the time in the session cache to ensure the oldest unused session is replaced first.  Previously the oldest session may not have been chosen, and a newer one replaced instead.</li><br />
<li>Fixed a null-termination error in a static buffer that caused a crash on some platforms using encrypted private keys.</li><br />
<li>Improved example code handling of return codes of sslRead().  Clarified that a 0 return code may indicate either a successful parse of a record with no application data, or an EOF.  Previously both cases were treated as EOF, which fits the examples, but isn't as useful for other applications.</li><br />
</ul><br />
