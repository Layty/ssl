<p>We've released a minor update to 1.0.  Support has been added for validation of X.509 certificates with serial numbers using more than 32 bits, improving compatibility with more certificates. This change affects the public sslCertInfo_t structure serialNumber field type and adds a new element, serialNumberLen to the structure.</p>
