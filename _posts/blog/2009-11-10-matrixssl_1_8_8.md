<b>Protocol Security Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>A security exploit around SSL re-negotiation has been discovered. This is a protocol level flaw, and affects all SSL and TLS implementations. The protocol sitting above SSL may or may not be affected. For example, HTTPS with keep-alive support on authenticated connections IS affected. MatrixSSL disables re-negotiation for server side SSL in this release, protecting secure servers from attack. When using MatrixSSL for client connections, care should be taken to only connect to SSL servers that have re-negotiation disabled.</li>
