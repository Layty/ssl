We've released an updated Beta 2 package to fix an issue with the example certificate file included with the initial release.  This certificate contained extensions that were not readable by Netscape 7 or Mozilla.  We have regenerated the certificates and included them in the latest source download, with an update to asn1.c.  These certificates are only for testing purposes and should not be used in an actual release.
