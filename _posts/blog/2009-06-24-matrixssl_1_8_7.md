<b>New Features</b>
<ul>
<li>Windows project files for library and example application builds are now based on the freely available Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express Edition</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Functional Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>The USE_MULTITHREADING define in matrixConfig.h is now off by default so that POSIX platforms will not require pthreads by default.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the size calculations for SSL_FULL conditions when encoding the FINISHED flight of handshake messages</li>
<li>
Additional checks and proper error handling for the following types of malformed X.509 certificates as tested by Orange Labs. These do not constitute a remote attack vector for the Open Source release.
<ul>
<li>Testing for Serial Number encodings that use bad length specifications</li>
<li>Testing for Distinguished Name extension encodings that use bad length specifications</li>
<li>Error handling for Subject Alternate Name extensions that use bad length specifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
