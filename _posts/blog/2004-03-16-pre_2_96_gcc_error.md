<p><b>Update: Fixed in 1.0</b><br />
A compiler error in the file pscrypto.h has been reported for pre gcc 2.96 compilers.  The error is related to the handling of curly braces in C macros.  As 2.96 is actually a misnomer for a development release of gcc 3.0, this explains the incompatibility with the preprocessor between such close release numbers.  A fix is available upon request and will be included in the next release.<br />
