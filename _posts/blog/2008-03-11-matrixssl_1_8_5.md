<b>API changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Internal API change to accommodate MatrixSSH users.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Functional changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Ignore TLS extensions sent with SSL 3.0 ClientHello.  Thunderbird sends these extensions if negotiating down from a TLS connection, even though they are meaningless.</li>
<li>Enhanced the parsing of the Key Usage certificate extension.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Bug fixes and optimizations</b>
<ul>
<li>Assure file reads into memory are NULL terminated.  This was an issue flagged by Valgrind that doesn't present a problem in practice.</li>
<li>2008 copyright update.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>MatrixSSL 1.8.4 was not a public release.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
