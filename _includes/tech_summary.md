Background
: MatrixSSL was first released in 2004 to provide secure connectivity to devices with a small memory footprint, and has evolved to also serve networking device requiring top performance. MatrixSSL is a lean and efficient C source code that is easy to integrate, and where bugs have few places to hide. 
: With no known security issue, an extensive implementation of TLS protocol, MatrixSSL is the SDK to look at to replace RSA/BSAFE or OpenSSL. 

MatrixSSL product family:
: - MatrixSSL with FIPS140-2 certified crypto (NIST cerificate 2389)
 - MatrixDTLS: A complete DTLS implementation
 - MatrixSSL Interceptor: A friendly way to monitor SSL/TLS traffic in real time without modifying the traffic (passive mode).
 - MatrixSSL for network processors: MatrixSSL delivers high performance on TILE-Gx, CAVIUM Octeon or Intel QuickAssist.
 - MatrixSSL Tiny: The smallest TLS implementation that requires 600 bytes of RAM and 10kB of flash and is ideal for extremely small microprocessors.
